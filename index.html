                <p class="text-faded">This project focusses on developing a mathematical model for the dynamics of vehicle–pavement coupled system. The pavement is modelled as a two-layer finite length Euler–Bernoulli beam with uniform cross-section resting on a nonlinear Pasternak foundation. A harmonic road roughness profile is considered for the pavement. The top layer of the pavement is modelled as a viscoelastic material representing the asphalt topping and the bottom layer is modelled as elastic material representing the base course. Burgers model is used to model the viscoelastic response of the top layer. Galerkin method and Runge–Kutta method are employed to discretise the differential equations arising from the dynamic equations of motion of the system. The vehicle is modelled as a spring-mass-damper system. The physical parameters of the system are compared for determining their influences on the coupled vibratory response. The effect of pavement roughness on the dynamic responses is also studied. The effects of acceleration of the vehicle and temperature on the response of the system are investigated. Additionally, the effect of coupling action on pavement displacements and vehicle body vertical displacement is examined numerically with the developed model. <span class="RlRed"></span></p>

          mobility, residency, and demography</h3>
        <p class="text-faded">    The emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases has been a global cause of concern in the past few decades. Previous research in the field has revealed that human connectivity and mobility behaviour play a major role in the spreading of an infectious disease. In this work, a multi-patch  model is proposed that take into account the effects of human mobility on the evolution of disease dynamics in a multi-population environment. In particular, the work develops  SEIRS multi-patch and multi-group epidemic models to practically account for distinct
          epidemiological-status-dependent mobilities in each patch. We rigorously show that the disease free equilibria (DFE) for both models are stable when R<sub>0</sub><1. We also prove that the models have a unique endemic asymptotically stable equilibrium when R<sub>0</sub>>1.
          We also introduce new local reproduction numbers from the point of view of the sub populations, and establish some important relation between them and the global reproduction number.
          Various numerical simulations are conducted to study the effects of  mobility and the residence time matrix on the evolution of the disease in individual patches and the overall environment. <span class="RlRed"></span></p>
